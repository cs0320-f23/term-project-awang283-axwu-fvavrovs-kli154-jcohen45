# Posters @ Brown

# Project details

##
Project description :

While organizations tend to advertise events on social media, through Today@Brown, and physical flyers, there is no centralized place for event-goers to filter all Brown events based on their interests. For example, if a member of the Brown community knows they want to attend a performance or knows they want to attend an event with free food, they would need to individually search for event advertisements from organizations they already know about. Posters @ Brown remedies this problem by providing a centralized advertising hub for Brown events that allows uploaders to tag their events with “free food,” “performance,” etc. (and then users can filter by these tags and dates). The application also serves as an archive of poster and visual design of student groups on campus over the years, which users can navigate with the same searching and tagging functionality. It allows for uploaders to upload a photo of an existing physical poster, and then the web app “reads” the text on the poster and auto-suggest tags that the uploader can approve, delete, or edit.
